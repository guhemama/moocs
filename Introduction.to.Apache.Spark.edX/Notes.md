# Week 1 - Apache Spark Programming Model

## The structure spectrum
Key data management concepts
* Data model: a collection of concepts for describing data.
* Schema: a description of a particular collection of data, using a given data model.

Data can be unstructured (schema-never), semi-structured (schema-later) and
structured (schema-first).

Spark can dynamically infer the schema or the programmer can inform it manually.
