# Week 1

## Queries with for
_for_ expressions can be used like a database query language, like SQL.

* case class Books(title: String, authors: List[String])
* for (b <- books; a <- b.authors if a startsWith "Bird") yield b.title
  
It works the same like generators in PHP, it only has a different syntax.
